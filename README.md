Ref: [ISC Diary: Querying Spamhaus for IP reputation, Author: Rick Wanner](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/27320)

Go, Swift, & R (mebbe more at some point) implementations of a command line tool to lookup IP reputation in Spamhaus.

Does ndjson if IPs are piped from stdin, otherwise does more human readable output.

|language | loc|
|:--------|---:|
|Go       |  81|
|Swift    |  75|
|R        |  49|

### Swift

```bash
$ cat test/ips | swift/spamhaus
{"code":"127.0.0.2","zone":"SBL","ip":"196.16.11.222","desc":"Spamhaus SBL Data"}
{"code":"127.0.0.9","zone":"SBL","ip":"196.16.11.222","desc":"Spamhaus DROP\/EDROP"}
{"code":"NA","zone":"NA","ip":"x","desc":"Not a valid IPv4 address"}
{"code":"nbl","zone":"NA","ip":"8.8.8.8","desc":"Not on any Spamhaus blocklist"}
```

### Go

```bash
$ golang/spamhaus 196.16.11.222 x 8.8.8.8
196.16.11.222 SBL Spamhaus SBL Data
196.16.11.222 SBL Spamhaus DROP/EDROP
x NA Not a valid IPv4 address
8.8.8.8 nbl Not on any Spamhaus blocklist
```

### R

```
$ R/spamhaus.R 196.16.11.222 x 8.8.8.8
