Ref: [ISC Diary: Querying Spamhaus for IP reputation, Author: Rick Wanner](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/27320)

Go, Swift, & R (mebbe more at some point) implementations of a command line tool to lookup IP reputation in Spamhaus.

Does ndjson if IPs are piped from stdin, otherwise does more human readable output.
